# Gesture-recognition-using-machine-learning-algorithms
Automatic Sign language recognition system is very beneficial for these human beings. It acts as a translator which acknowledges the signal language of disable human beings and converts it into voice or texts so that normal humans can understand. It makes the life of extra ordinary people quite simpler. These systems record the videos and for recognition, region of interests are identified and tracked from the motion pictures and pics. Machine learning algorithms are used to train the models for getting the maximum accuracy in recognition.

## Methodology
* Media pipe line is setup  and data is collected in order to train the custom machine learning model and save down in csv file.
* Features are extracted from the datasets and image processing is done.
* Different machine learning algorithms are applied and prediction is done in real time.
* Text will be displayed on the screen according to the actions given as the input by the user through web cam.
